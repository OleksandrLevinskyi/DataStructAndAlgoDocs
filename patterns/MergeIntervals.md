### Description:
* efficient to deal with overlapping intervals
* find overlapping intervals or merge intervals if they overlap
* given two intervals (a and b), there will be six different ways the two intervals can relate to each other
* inserting intervals, optimizing interval merges

### To identify:
* produce a list with only mutually exclusive intervals
* when hearing the term “overlapping intervals”

### Common problems:
* intervals intersection (medium)
* maximum cpu load (hard)
