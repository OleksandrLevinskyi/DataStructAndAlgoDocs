# Tree DFS

### Description:
* uses recursion or a stack for the iterative approach to keep track of all the previous (parent) nodes while traversing
* 3 types: process a current node right away (pre-order), between processing two children (in-order), or after processing both children (post-order)
* makes two recursive calls for both the children of the current node to process them

### To identify:
* traverse a tree with in-order, preorder, or postorder DFS
* searching for something where the node is closer to a leaf

### Common problems:
* sum of path numbers (medium)
* all paths for a sum (medium)
