<img src="https://github.com/OleksandrLevinskyi/DataStructAndAlgoDocs/blob/main/patterns/images/two-pointers.png" alt="two pointers" width="300"/>

### Description:
* two pointers iterate through the data structure in tandem until one or both of the pointers hit a certain condition
* useful when searching pairs in a sorted array or linked list (compare each element of an array to its other elements)
* help improve time/space complexity of a one pointer solution

### To identify:
* find a set of elements that fulfill certain constraints in sorted arrays or linked lists
* the set of elements in the array is a pair, a triplet, or even a subarray

### Common problems:
* squaring a sorted array (easy)
* triplets that sum to zero (medium)
* comparing strings that contain backspaces (medium)
