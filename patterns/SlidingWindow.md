### Description:
* perform a required operation on a specific window size of a given array or linked list
* start from the 1st element and keep shifting right by one element and adjust the length of the window according to the problem
* window size can remain constant or grow/shrink

### To identify:
* the input is a linear data structure (linked list, array, or string)
* find the longest/shortest substring, subarray, or a desired value

### Common problems:
* finding the longest subarray containing all 1s
* maximum sum subarray of size ‘K’ (easy)
* the longest substring with ‘K’ distinct characters (medium)
* string anagrams (hard)
