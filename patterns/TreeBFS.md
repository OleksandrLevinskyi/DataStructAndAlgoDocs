# Tree BFS

### Description:
* uses a queue to keep track of all the nodes of the same level before moving to the next one
* pushes the root node to the queue and then continually iterates until the queue is empty, removing the node at the head of the queue
* insert all of its children into the queue after removing each node from the queue

### To identify:
* traversal of a tree in a level-by-level order (or level order traversal)

### Common problems:
* binary tree level order traversal (easy)
* zigzag traversal (medium)
